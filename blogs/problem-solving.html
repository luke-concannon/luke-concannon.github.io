            <h2>Solving Problems, Since 1986</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now, I've been solving problems since day dot. Life is full of
              them. One after the other, they just keep coming at me. So I like
              to think I'm well practiced in solving problems. But in the quest
              to become a more proficient finder of solutions, here are some
              reflections on smashing through some problems in my first few
              weeks of coding....<br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Look here Object, give me that damn nested value!</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              This week I came across a steadfast roadblock in my javascripting.
              I was trying to dynamically insert into an Object some properties
              from two other arrays. The complexity came in the fact that the
              values from one array were to be nested in the object as keys,
              with the values of those key being nested objects (which were to
              include the corresponding values from the second array). I managed
              to loop through the arrays and successfully insert the first
              arrays values as keys in my object, but when trying to insert the
              second array's values as a nested object representing the values
              of the target Objects keys, I came completely unstuck!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>TEST - FAIL - TEST - FAIL</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              I find this to be my default problem solving technique. With
              console.log() as my trusty sidekick, I can test and fail till the
              cows come home. They say that failing or making mistakes is one
              step closer to success. Yeh right, until it isn't! Testing things
              and failing is the nature of programming, and an important problem
              solving technique, but unless supported by other approaches, you
              will eventually meet problems that totally stump you!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>GOBBLE UP THAT ONLINE CONTENT!</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Having drained the well of my knowledge I then bash my problem
              into Google, open up a bunch of tabs and gobble up as much
              learning as I can in as short a time as possible. A tried and true
              approach to solving problems, and one that we all rely on daily.
              In this instance, no joy - I must have read 20 different articles
              on all the which ways I can loop through objects. Then I decided
              the loop wasnt actually the issue and that instead I'm just not
              using the correct notation to access the values I need. And herein
              lise an issue with relying on referencing others' content in
              trying to solve your problem, you are relying on 2 things - the
              fact that you know exactly what your problem is; and the fact that
              someone else has experienced this problem. I half knew what my
              problem was, and so couldn't really find resolution from others'
              experiences.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>SEEKING HELP FROM A REAL PERSON</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The single most effective way to tackle problems is by
              collaborating with other human beings. It is also sometimes the
              hardest thing to do. Maybe because we it feels like we're
              admitting failure in asking for the answer, or maybe it's just
              because we are ego driven creatures that find it difficult to
              admit to ourselves we are stuck. Either way, doesn't change the
              fact that asking a real human person will bring all the joy of any
              other problem solving technique 10 times over (caveat: most of the
              time). So this is what I did. I reached out to someone on the
              slack channel, they hit me up with some code and I laughed in the
              face of its elegance and simplicity. Truly, I had overcomplicated
              my problem to a comical degree.

            <br />

            <h3>PSEUDOCODE</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Writing pseudocode is a great way to plan your approach. But there
              is pseduocode and there is <em>pseduocode</em>. Currently the
              pseduocode I write feels more like a description of what I think I
              should do rather than a specific list of code I will write -
              mainly because I don't have enough tools in my JS toolbox to draw
              on when planning my aproach. This will change with practice and
              up-skilling.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>TRYING SOMETHING</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              This I am well versed in. It's my default problem solving
              approach. Have an idea, try it, fail, finesse the code, try it,
              fail...
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>RUBBER DUCKY METHOD</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Explaining to your rubber ducky the problem, and potential
              solutions. I get it but am yet to try it. Sometimes I begin to
              explain puzzles to my girlfriend and I see the value - the rubber
              ducky (or love partner) has no sense of what you are talking
              about, so you have to break it down in novel ways to try to get
              them to understand. In this lies the value.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>READING ERROR MESSAGES</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sometimes the error messages are hugely helpful e.g. when you are
              missing a curly bracket or calling on an undefined variable. Other
              times they are utterly not helpful, and can be downright abusive,
              with their red angry color and monospace font. grrrr.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>CONSOLE.LOGGING</h3>

            <br />
            <p>
              My friend, the console.log - A true companion in finding out what
              the hell your code is actually asking the computer to do! The
              console.log is like asking the computer for a little clue to the
              problem. It is a great way to debug and identify specific pieces
              of code and their affects.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>GOOGLING</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The world is a different place because of the internet, and search
              engines are an essential tool in accessing the information we
              need. A great learning tool in any industry, but a vital one for
              programmers - like the bible for Christians, search engines give
              us access the knowledge that will guide us to heaven!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>ASKING YOUR PEERS FOR HELP</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Hard to do, but hugely effective. This approach is used after all
              other approaches have failed. I think I could use it sooner and
              more regularly, but I also think that a little bit of struggle
              before doing this is important.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>ASKING COACHES FOR HELP</h3>
            <br />
            <p>I haven't got to this yet, saving it up for BootCamp!</p>
            <br />
            <h3>IMPROVING YOUR PROCESS WITH REFLECTION</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Reflection is hugely effective and can be immensely enjoyable. I
              feel well practiced in building a reflexive practice in my working
              life - in a previous incarnation as a teacher, reflection lay at
              the centre of our professional development and I think it should
              do for all people in all situations. I work with many people in
              factory settings that are not exposed to reflection, and when they
              get to experience it they feel stretched and challenged to
              consider their journey from the perspective opf the 'observer'.
