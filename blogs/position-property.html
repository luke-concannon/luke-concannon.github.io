              If there has been one single most frustrating theme in my initial
              CSS learning, it has been aligning elements. Grrrr, just go where
              I want you to annoying cluster of pixels!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Talking about pixels... Among the articles I read when researching
              <em>positioning</em> there was one that began with making a simple
              but important concept crystal clear:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                An important concept to understand first is that every single
                element on a web page is a block. Literally a rectangle of
                pixels.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <br />
            <p style="font-size: 0.8em">
              (TO THE AUTHOR - I promise I will cite you later when I am not
              chasing my tail pretending to be a web developer...)
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So all that you commit to that beloved main branch (tech speak,
              don't worry about it &#128514;) is blocks of pixels. And to make
              these blocks of pixels go where you want you have several tools at
              your disposal, but today is all about the property
              <em>position</em>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>There are 5 main values of the position property.</p>

            <h2>What happens when I position: absolute?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              An <strong>absolutely</strong> positioned element is removed from
              the document flow and is positioned automatically to the top-left
              of its parent element. It no longer is positioned relative to the
              overall document, but only to its parent element. By removing it
              from the webpage flow, you are influencing the position of other
              elements.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If you imagine a kid is having heaps of fun in a group of kids,
              they are all collaborating, playing around with each other, then a
              helicpter parent comes and lifts the kid from the group to play on
              there own - this is absolute positioning!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>What happens when I position: relative?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              A <strong>relatively</strong> positioned element is located
              relative to itself. It is the badboy of positioning properties, it
              only cares about itself. "Did you say move 10px left? ok tough
              guy, but I'm only doing it relative to my original position!"
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Relative positioning is such a selfish beast that it does not
              affect the position of other elements! How rude.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>What happens when I position: fixed?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Like position: absolute, <strong>fixed</strong> positioned
              elements are also removed from the normal document flow. The
              differences are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They are only relative to the document, not any other parents.
              </li>
              <li>They are not affected by scrolling.</li>
            </ul>
