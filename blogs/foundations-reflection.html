            <h2>
              Three new things I've learnt about myself and my ego as a result
              of CORE...
            </h2>
            <br />
            <h3>- Perfectionism can be inhibiting</h3>
            <br />
            <h3>
              - Asking for help - Less inclined than I thought I would be!
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h3>
              - What other people think - I care more than I thought I would
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>
              What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in
              learning and programming?
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              These three attributes (abilities? capabilities?) play a
              collaborative, intertwining dance with regards to learning and
              programming.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
              They facilitate connection and collaboration. They prioritise a
              level of consciousness and awareness that is not only essential
              for creative problem solving, but shapes your mind in a way that
              allows for learning to be experienced in a more dynamic way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I think something needs to be said about the state of the tech
              industry in the world right now and the quite blatant impact NOT
              prioritising these attributes has on the way people operate.
              Highly creative, intelligent people are showing a disregard for
              values and empathy, choosing profit, legacy and growth over
              enhancing the human experience.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              I found elements of the core learning provocative and just plain
              difficult, which came as a complete surprise! When we were asked
              to explore our values and identity, a simple task right, NO! It
              through me into fits of existential stagnation as I dredged
              through the reeds asking myself questions like "What do I really
              actually value? But do I represent that value in anyway or am I
              just wearing it like a badge?!"
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Itâ€™s a simple but profound recognition of the essential role
              emotions play in the narrative of all that we experience.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>
              What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sharing with peers that i haven't met was a challenge. I found
              that I re-read things multiple times, considering how it could be
              perceived and worrying that it could be misunderstood. Also, just
              in general being vulnerable in a digital space is a strange duet.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>
              Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so
              much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp
              course?
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              I'd like to think that you begin curriculum development from the
              place of "what kind of developers do we want to create?" I think
              you have recognised the powerful tools at programmers disposal and
              are making an admirable stab at shifting the role technology plays
              in the human story.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
              waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
              programming instead?
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              I don't think so. I have found it to be a highly engagement
              element to the foundation curriculum. I also think it has been the
              single most effective part of the curriculum in connecting the EDA
              students before bootcamp. There is a real sense of camaraderie
              even before people have met each other.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Saying that, and being completely candid here, I have found that
              the core segments were the last things I came to each week. I
              would like to spend more time considering the questions as I could
              write and think for ages, but I have felt pressured to devote time
              largely to the programming and have rarely put more time into the
              core stuff.
