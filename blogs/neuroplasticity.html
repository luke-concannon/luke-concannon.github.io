            <h2>"Neurons that Fire Together, Wire Together"</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Your brain is more than just a 3 pound ball of jelly that I
              imagine tastes delicious (based on what the brains of other beasts
              taste like... apologies to all the vegans out there). It is a
              complex map of neural pathways with firing synapses left, right
              and centre. It's a veritable disco of electrical activity
              responding to the things you ask it to do each and every moment of
              your life. Choose to kick a football and the unique set of neural
              pathways required to make that happen will light up like a
              christmas tree. Do it again tomorrow and it will light up again.
              Do it again the next day and that specific combination of neural
              pathways is starting to get pretty well versed in firing - so much
              so that the neurons begin to wire together, making the pathway
              more efficient. A path well trodden if you will<br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Does that mean we can become <em>more cleverer?</em></h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              The concept of <em>Intelligence</em> is fraught with contradiction
              and conflicting ideaologies. EQ... IQ... OMG...WTF. We can however
              agree that there are diffferent types of intelligence, and what is
              becoming clearer through research is that many of these
              intelligences are flexible i.e. NOT FIXED. This follows on
              logically from the concept of neuroplascticity and being able to
              literally <strong>shape</strong> our brains by doing and thinking.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>The Hallowed Era of the Growth Mindset</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              So we have this proven concept of our brains as a malleable chunk
              of clay that we can shape as we so desire. But we also have a
              conflicting idea that we are born with a set of fixed cognitive
              attributes, our intelligence, that sets our capacity to learn and
              achieve throughout our lives. What do we do when we have 2
              conflicting ideas? FIGHT, FIGHT FIGHT! We put them in a ring and
              see who wins (or gather reems of peer reviewed research and try to
              scientifically prove one over the other). In the corner of
              flexible intelligence was Carol Dweck, an American psychologist
              who proposed that the idea of fixed mindset was absurd when in
              actuality we have the opportunity to enhance our learning. Her
              idea of
              <a href="https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth Mindset</a>
              cast egg on the faces of all those that perceived their
              intelligence as set from birth. It turns out all they did was
              limit their own capacity to learn and become more capable,
              intelligent human beings! YES, your own belief in Growth vs Fixed
              Mindset can influence your ability to harness neuroplascticity in
              your favour! Kind of like if you convince yourself you may see a
              unicorn in People's Coffee you are more likely to actually see
              that unicorn. Yes, my metaphor is backed by a wealth of research
              HERE, HERE and HERE (oh I momentarily forgot how to hyperlink
              text...)

            <h2>Become the Potter of your own Intelligence</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              How do we take advantage of our new found cognitive plasticity?
              Here are some totally achievable tips to becoming the potter of
              your own intelligence! (your brain is the clay - for those that
              thought the analogy too abstract):
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                REPETITION! REPETITION! REPETITION! - Practicing things is
                hugely effective in building those neural pathways. But we
                mainly already knew that.
              </li>
              <li>
                CHALLENGE and NOVELTY - Doing new and challenging things helps
                create novel connections in your brain, developing a more
                diverse map of neural pathways.
              </li>
              <li>
                AWARENESS - Just actively considering the fact that you can
                shape your own learning / intelligence / capability gives you a
                more potent ability to take advantage of neuroplascticity. Go
                on, think it now.
              </li>
              <li>
                BALANCE - Hard work is a given. But how good are we at resting,
                relaxing, enjoying the birds and the bees (literally and
                euphemistically)? Also, sleeping, meditating and conscious
                attention. All great and useful tools in our quest to learn the
                things we previosly considered out of reach!
              </li>
