            <h2>The (DRAFT) Vision</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Firstly, I have an immediate need to upskill to drive the
              development of the tech product we are offering as part of the
              business I am involved in. Having come from a paper based system
              almost 10 years ago, it has been digitised and is now evolving
              into and online tool. Heaps of potential and a customer base to
              drive its development, I just need the skills to take it to othe
              next level / build a team that can help me take it there!
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Secondly, I want to develop a set of transferable skills that will
              allow me to explore other directions / projects in the future. My
              current situation was/is a pretty niche opportunity in that I have
              grown into a family business over the years after tarting up a few
              spreadsheets for the business. I love the job as it affords me
              lots of flexibility and freedom of choosing my own direction.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Across both of these goals, I wish to develop a clearer
              understanding of my own value system. What exactly is it I’m
              trying to achieve with the things I am building? How do I want my
              work to contribute to something bigger than just myself and my
              family?
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">
              Some (non-technical!) Things I'd like to Develop:
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                My ability to collaborate in real-time with a group of people
              </li>
              <li>
                My ability to communicate technical concepts and direction in
                simple and compelling terms
              </li>
              <li>
                My ability to identify and communicate the key things any given
                stakeholder needs to hear i.e. not providing needless tech
                context for stakeholders that don’t need it!
              </li>
              <li>
                My ability to delegate and collaborate to achieve a common goal.
                I work in a silo and I would like to build a team over the
                coming years
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h2>Me, Myself, and I</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              A little about me as a learner, through mine very own eyeballs!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Things I'm Proud of:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I consider myself a jack of all trades, able to pivot and learn
                what needs to be learnt to journey towards the greater goal
              </li>
              <li>
                I can deep dive on topics I'm drawn towards and can become
                almost obsessive about new hobbies/industries
              </li>
              <li>
                Asking questions is a place I feel comfortable, which is
                incredibly useful in a learning context
              </li>
              <li>
                Beginners mindset is also a comfortable place for me to exist.
                I'm well practiced in starting on new pathways and find it
                natural to play padawan to someone else’s Jedi
              </li>
              <li>
                Feedback and constructive criticism are not things I find
                difficult to take on board.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Things I'm working on:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Being a jack of all trades, I'm also a master of none!</li>
              <li>
                Direction - I fall back on the idea that your career / life ebbs
                and flows in mysterious ways and you should trust in this
                organic approach, but sometimes I also worry that I'm not
                purposeful enough or lack direction or conviction
              </li>
              <li>
                I lack confidence working in groups. Public speaking I find
                particularly uncomfortable.
              </li>
              <li>
                By nature I need time to be creative / to solidify learning. I
                struggle in real-time group contexts e.g. group brain-storming
                sessions or collaborative workshops. I find I need to go away on
                my own, process what is required, then bring my findings back to
                the group.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h2>My Bootcamp Manifesto</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>- ROUTINE</h3>
            <p>
              I benefit hugely from routines and plan to establish a daily
              routine whilst living in Wellington for the 9 weeks
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- GOAL SETTING</h3>
            <p>
              I will be clear with myself around what exactly I am aiming to
              achieve in any given working block. I have a tendency to go deep
              down rabbit holes and work in a very linear fashion.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- BALANCE</h3>
            <p>
              Man it is so easy to work for 12 hours straight on a screen when
              you are doing something you love and can immediately see the
              results! I will commit to breaking up my efforts, using pomodoro
              timer and establishing a routine that involves commitments to
              analog activities outside of the binary existence! Sports,
              friends, walks, maybe a few friday night beersies with Piwakawaka
              crew!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- RELATIONSHIPS</h3>
            <p>
              I am looking forward to getting to know my EDA cohort and believe
              that in any given situation, the relationships you build are the
              most important factor in working productively and safely with
              other learners. Understanding other people, or at least
              empathising with the fact we all come from different backgrounds
              and have different goals/needs, provides a good foundation to
              working with others effectively
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- COMMUNICATION</h3>
            <p>
              We are privileged to live in an era where talking about how you
              feel is not only acceptable but a priority. I hope to communicate
              honestly and openly with others on the course.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- SUSTENANCE</h3>
            <p>
              I will maintain caffeination and a full belly at all times. No one
              wants to see a hangry Luke.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- TAKING BREAKS</h3>
            <p>
              The joys of stopping, doing a few star jumps / cracking a bad joke
              with a friend / taking a quick walk and then revisiting whatever
              is getting to you is a bloody marvelous technique!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- SHARING PROBLEMS</h3>
            <p>
              ‘A problem shared is a problem halved!’ I’m loving the open source
              feel to the EDA course so far and can see the value in coming back
              to the idea of open source in more contexts than just code!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>- ASKING FOR HELP</h3>
            <p>
              This is definitely something that is good to practice. Again it
              fits the open source approach to things. Help from a real person
              is untouchable in its value!
            </p>
