            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>According to the binary know-it-all (wikipedia):</p>
            <br />
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “Emotional intelligence (EI or EQ) is most often defined as the
                ability to perceive, use, understand, manage, and handle
                emotions.”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <br />
            <p>
              It’s a simple but profound recognition of the essential role
              emotions play in the narrative of all that we experience.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Collaborating with a colleague on a project? - both of you will
              have an underlying emotional journey you are traveling whilst
              completing this project; working alone to debug an issue with your
              app? - you will have an underlying emotional journey you are
              traveling whilst completing this debugging. Working in a large
              group to introduce and get to know each other? Every single person
              has an underlying emotional journey they are traveling whilst
              experiencing this moment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Emotional Intelligence refers to a person’s awareness of this
              emotional journey in themselves and in others. EQ also refers to
              the ability to shape your behaviour appropriately based on your
              awareness of the emotional content of your own and others people
              behaviour.
            </p>
            <br />

              An example. A pair of front-end devs walk into a bar (best start
              to a not-joke ever)... They’re both working on independent
              projects and are sharing their projects with one another as
              colleagues and buddies. Dev A knows that Dev B recently got the
              bash from a client around a website they’d designed. Instead of
              Dev A launching into showing off their project to Dev B, they
              purposefully commit time to being a positive audience for Dev B,
              providing confidence boosting compliments and making positive
              statements. Dev A is showing their emotional intelligence here.
              Some may say that this is just being a good friend, and it is!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence is the practice of bring some of those
              qualities of awareness we have when we are operating as
              peak-friend into the rest of our lives.
            </p>

            <h2>How is it Different to IQ (Intelligence Quotient)?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Intelligence quotient or IQ is a score received from standardized
              assessments designed to test intelligence. IQ relates directly to
              intellectual pursuits such as the ability to learn as well as
              understand and apply information to skill sets. IQ covers logical
              reasoning, word comprehension and math skills. People with higher
              IQ can think in abstracts and make connections by making
              generalizations easier.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Why is Emotional Intelligence Relevant to Me?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              It is important because it is threaded between every moment we
              ever experience, on our own and with others. We are emotional
              beings. It is part of what makes us human and to not practice the
              skills involved with EQ is to avoid the joy of experiencing a part
              of who we are.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Also, if you ever want to have anything to do with other human
              beings, you better get practicing those EQ skills, or hope the
              people on the receiving end of your lack of emotional awareness is
              an absolute jedi in EQ, acceptance, non-judgment and compassion!
