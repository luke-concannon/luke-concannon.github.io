            <h2>Meet HTML and CSS (and JasaScript!)...</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Luke, my friends call me HTML. This is my partner
              Milo. Her friends call her CSS.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We have our own property development business (don't worry, we
              make affordable homes for first time buyers!) and find that our
              skillsets are totally complimentary! Now I'm what you could call
              the chippy. I love to build things - a floor, a wall, a roof, you
              name it I will build it. The thing is, it just looks like a floor,
              or a wall, or a roof when I'm done. Entirely functional,
              completely drab. So drab in fact that the stuff I build doesnt
              even really DO anything. It just sits there, waiting to made
              beautiful and useful. This is where Milo comes in! She is a weapon
              of beautification. She can take that reassuringly functional
              concrete floor I built and lay a stunning hardwood tongue and
              groove floor over it. KAZZAM! what a potent combination.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Our friend Cosmo (or JavaScript to their mates) is also involved
              in our business. Cosmo takes the beautiful wall that Milo and I
              created and adds a built in extractor fan that keeps our house
              clean from kitchen smells!
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>'Control Flow' and 'Loops' in Real Life</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Ok, <em>Control Flow</em>...</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Imagine a book. You know, that dead-tree version of pixels we used
              to store amazing things in. Your average-joe of a book you read
              from start to finish. Page 1 - Page [last]. If you've written a
              bunch of JS code and this experience of reading a book from start
              to finish is the most relevant metaphor, your JS code is almost
              unbelievably simple and potentially not viable...
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Instead, <em>Control Flow</em> is more like reading a
              <strong>Create Your Own Adventure</strong> book. No-way is this
              read going to be start to finish! You get to a point and there are
              decisions to be made, dice to be rolled, serious quantum physics
              to be resolved before the next step can be taken...
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is where <em>loops</em> can really take a hit on your desire
              to progress in a linear fashion!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A loop in Javascript is like this... You're cruising through your
              create-your-own-adventure book and you come up against a fork in
              the road. The book asks "of the 5 characters you are on this
              adventure with, if more than 3 of them are scared of the dark,
              take the hill route; if less than 3 are scared of the dark you can
              take the gloomy valley path (it's quicker, but scarier!")
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Another great comparison - Monopoly! Monopoly is control flow and
              loops in action. Rare is it that you get to cruise though and
              collect your $200. More common that you go to prison, or get a
              community chest card that forwards you to Pall Mall. Someone might
              land on your property and you have to figure out rents for each
              player (a loop!)
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>The DOM - What and Why?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              HTML, CSS and JS are lietrally different languages. If you imagine
              them as people speaking vastly different languages, they find it
              difficult to tell one another what to do. This is where the DOM or
              Document Object Model comes in handy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The DOM is a translation of your HTML into a common language that
              everyone can understand. From here, CSS and JS can use the common
              language to guide HTML.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Technically speaking, the DOM represents your web content as a
              hierachical tree of objects, one parent to each child object. JS
              can identify these objects to affect function, style and content.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Arrays and Objects |The Many Ways to Store Information</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Arrays and Objects are two ways we store information in
              Javascript.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              ARRAYS are a way for us to store a list of data in a single
              variable. They are particularly handy when you want to create
              <em>ordered collections</em>. Each entry within the array has a
              number repsenting its position, the first entry sitting as [0].
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              OBJECTS are a little different - they tend to be
              <em>things</em> that have information relating to the
              <em>thing</em> i.e. a person that has a bunch of data relating to
              who they are (Luke - Age:35, Eye color: blue). An OBJECT stores
              its information in KEY:VALUE pairs. In the previous example, Age
              would have been the Key and 35 would have been the value for that
              key. In this way we access the data in different ways.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>The Awesomeness of Functions</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              In a muddle of confusingly named concepts, FUNCTIONS in JavaScript
              are probably the most helpfully named concept in the entirety of
              the computing language. They do what they say on the tin. They
              make things happen. They take a set of rules and follow those
              rules. You can pump whatever recipe you want into that function
              and it will the recipe to the book! Functions are really what
              makes JS magical, they take information and ask the question "how
              can we use this information to create something new?"
